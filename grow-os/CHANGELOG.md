# Changelog

## 1.0.20

- Simplified — removed the confusing "HA Entity" field from the Sensors (hardware) form. It
  never actually connected anything: live values come only from the per-tent mapping on the
  Home Assistant page. Sensors are now purely physical inventory (name, type, tent,
  calibration, maintenance); entities are mapped in exactly one place — the Home Assistant tab.

## 1.0.19

- Fixed (major) — mapped RDWC/DWC reservoir sensors (pH, EC, water temp, ORP, DO, water
  level) now show their live values on the dashboard as soon as they are mapped, even
  before the grow has any measurements. Previously the reservoir tiles stayed blank ("—")
  unless the grow was recognized as active-hydro or a manual measurement already existed.
- Clearer wording on the Sensors page: the mapping hint no longer reads "HA getrennt"
  (which looked like a lost connection) — it now explains that entities are mapped under
  the Home Assistant tab, and that the add-on connection itself is always active.

## 1.0.18

- Improved — the sidebar navigation now reads clearly as clickable: a pointer cursor on
  hover, a distinct green hover highlight with an outline, and brighter idle text so the
  menu items no longer look like static labels.

## 1.0.17

- Fixed — the Home Assistant page no longer shows the connection as "inactive" when
  running as an add-on. As an add-on the connection is automatic (Supervisor token), so
  the status card now reads "active · via add-on".

## 1.0.16

- New — threshold alerts with push notifications. Under **Alarme** you can set a min/max
  per sensor (pH, EC, water temp, ORP, DO, air temp, humidity, VPD, CO₂). Grow OS sends a
  push to your phone through Home Assistant when a value goes out of range — pick your HA
  notify service from a dropdown and send a test push. Edge-triggered with a cooldown so
  you are not spammed.
- Fixed — the Reservoir section on the live dashboard now shows your reservoir sensor
  values as soon as they are mapped (RDWC/DWC group), even before a grow is running, with
  a hint that grow-specific targets and addback need a DWC/RDWC grow.

## 1.0.15

- Fixed: live sensor values could suddenly blank out (showing "—") and only came
  back after leaving and reopening the dashboard. A transient connection hiccup on
  the 30-second background refresh was wiping the values; the dashboard now keeps
  the last good readings instead of clearing them.

## 1.0.14

- Launch cleanup. Removed the unused in-app remote-access / admin-key settings —
  as a Home Assistant add-on, Home Assistant already handles authentication and
  remote access (web and mobile app), so no separate key is needed.
- Removed dead offline/PWA plumbing that never activated behind the ingress.
- Internal only: no action required, and your data on `/data` is preserved across
  the update as usual.
