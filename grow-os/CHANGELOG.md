# Changelog

## 1.0.15

- Fixed: live sensor values could suddenly blank out (showing "—") and only came
  back after leaving and reopening the dashboard. A transient connection hiccup on
  the 30-second background refresh was wiping the values; the dashboard now keeps
  the last good readings instead of clearing them.

## 1.0.14

- Launch cleanup. Removed the unused in-app remote-access / admin-key settings —
  as a Home Assistant add-on, Home Assistant already handles authentication and
  remote access (web and mobile app), so no separate key is needed.
- Removed dead offline/PWA plumbing that never activated behind the ingress.
- Internal only: no action required, and your data on `/data` is preserved across
  the update as usual.
